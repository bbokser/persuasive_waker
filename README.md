### Hardware
- LED corresponding to each 'setting'
- Battery built-in, difficult to remove
- LED hard built-in to indicate PC write access not software-dependent
- Add back E-ink
- Temp and humidity?

### Software
- Stop blinking while setting time
- Integrate FSM better
- Set a min time between inkdisp refreshes so that it doesn't refresh too frequently
- Piezo music
- Battery meter
