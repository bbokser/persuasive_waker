## Getting Started
1. Install two AA batteries in the battery compartment.
2. Using the provided screws, screw the back plate onto the case with the batteries on the inner side.
3. Connect the clock to a power source via the USB cable. The batteries are for backup and should not be relied on for power on a day-to-day basis (they will run out fairly quickly).
4. Press the date button and select the year by rotating the knob. Press the knob inwards to hit "enter".
5. You will now be asked to enter in the month, followed by the day of the month.
6. Press the time button to set the time of day in a similar manner. 

## A Note About the Screen
The screen is E-paper. E-paper cannot refresh as quickly as most other display types. The display is set to refresh only once every three minutes. This means you will have to wait a few minutes for changes to the date and alarm to show up on the screen.

## Additional Functionality
- You can set the alarm time by pressing the alarm button.
- If you wish to cancel your alarm, press the alarm button and then press the "back" button.
- The brightness button will allow you to set the screen brightness.

## Pairing With a New Key Fob
The remote switch receiver is an [RX480E](https://qiachip.com/products/2x-learning-code-receiver-module-for-rf-433mhz-rx-480-e-remote-control-arduino-chip-28131mm-pcb). Use the following instructions to pair a new key fob with your alarm clock (This won't be necessary straight out of the box).

1. Delete existing data by pressing the RF button 8 times. You should see the LED flash 7 times.
2. Learn the new remote by pressing the RF button once. (Note that if you instead press the button twice or thrice in a row, you'll go into other modes, such as toggle mode, which aren't useful for this device. See the link above for more details).
3. The LED should light up, at which point you should press the button on the key fob.
4. You should see the LED flash 3 times. From now on the LED should light up whenever you hit the remote button.
